Dear reader,

This is a documentation which tries to capture the progress done in the implementation of sectoral water usage in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). It includes all the changes done to the existing model components, as well as short description of what was done and why.

This documentation is a work in progress, as the project is still not finished. Therefore the content is subject to change as we will advance with the source code development, testing and validation.

You can start reading the documentation from the [Model Development for Sectoral Water Usage](Documentation/Model_Development_for_Sectoral_Water_Usage.md) file, which will guide you through the development process.

Best regards,\
