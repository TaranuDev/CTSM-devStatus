Dear reader,

This is a documentation which tries to capture the progress done in the representation of human water interface in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). 
It may contain contain an overview of the previous development and existing features in CESM; some information and references on other models and how they approached this problem; but the main focus is describing the current model development done by Ioan Sabin Taranu during his PhD project (2021-2025).

This documentation is a work in progress, as the project is still not finished. Therefore the content is subject to change as we will advance with the source code development, testing and validation.

You can start reading the documentation from the [Model Development](obsidian/Model_Development_for_Sectoral_Water_Usage.md), which will guide you through the development process.

Best regards,\
Sabin Taranu
