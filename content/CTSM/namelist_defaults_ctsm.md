## General discussion:
We saw previously in the [namelist definition](CTSM/namelist_definition_ctsm.md) the new added variables which can be changed by the user to control the model. 

In case if the user do not provide any values for these variables, we have to provide some default values ourselves so that the model can work properly.  It is here that these default values are provided.
